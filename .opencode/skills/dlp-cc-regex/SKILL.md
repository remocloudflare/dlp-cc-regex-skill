# DLP Regex Builder

Guidance for the Cloudflare DLP Regex Builder. This Worker provides high-confidence
security and secrets presets and validates and scans patterns with Rust regex in WASM.
Local Wrangler development is the default; Terraform is only for infrastructure and
production deployment.

## When to use

Load this skill for changes to:

- `src/index.js`, the preset catalog, `/scan`, or the browser UI.
- `src/regex-validator.js` or `src/regex_validator.wasm`.
- `rust-regex-validator/` or `scripts/build-regex-validator.sh`.
- Terraform Worker/DLP resources, README examples, screenshots, or production deployment.

## Project invariants

- Cloudflare DLP uses **Rust regex syntax**, not RE2 or JavaScript/PCRE syntax.
- Rust/WASM validation and matching are authoritative. Never execute user-supplied
  patterns with JavaScript `RegExp` on the server or in the Worker preview path.
- Enforce Cloudflare constraints before compiling: maximum 1,024 UTF-8 bytes and no
  unbounded `+` or `*` quantifiers. Use explicit bounded quantifiers.
- Preserve high-confidence detection. Prefer provider prefixes, fixed signatures,
  explicit context, bounded alphabets, and adversarial negative fixtures. Do not add
  generic `password=`, `secret=`, or `token=` detectors without explicit approval.
- Never commit real credentials, tokens, private keys, Terraform state, tfvars, or
  live secret material. Synthetic fixtures must be visibly nonfunctional.
- Keep the shared penguin background and attribution intact unless the user requests
  a visual change:
  `https://itlinux.cc/assets/bg.webp?v=5`
- Keep the footer bio accurate: Remo Mattei, Cloudflare One, Zero Trust, Workers,
  and Linux demos at itlinux.cc. Do not invent credentials or job titles.

## Sales and customer deployment

The public demo at `https://dlp-regex.itlinux.cc/` is for demonstrations only and
requires no login, token, npm, Terraform, or Cloudflare account. Use synthetic
samples; never paste real customer credentials.

Customer deployment is a separate customer-owned operation. Confirm the customer
has Zero Trust/DLP enabled, an account ID, and an API token with **Account → Zero
Trust → Edit**. Add **Account → Workers Scripts → Edit** only when deploying the
Worker. The customer must approve the traffic inspection/TLS/Gateway design and
store the token in their own secret manager or deployment environment. Never ask
for, paste, log, or commit the token in the skill or repository.

## Catalog changes

Every non-custom preset must include:

- `id`, `category`, `label`, `regex`, `validation`, `note`.
- `positiveSamples` and `negativeSamples` with every claimed token family exercised.
- `sample` and `negativeSample` derived from those fixture arrays.
- Positive and negative tests for exact lengths, delimiters, embedded names, malformed
  suffixes, and allowed-alphabet continuations.

Security presets use `validation: "none"`. Credit-card presets may use `"luhn"`.
Keep category names stable because the UI renders them as option groups.

## Worker/API rules

- Read request bodies with the bounded streaming reader; reject oversized bodies
  before retaining them and cancel the reader when the limit is exceeded.
- Reject malformed JSON, `null`, arrays, non-object bodies, invalid UTF-8, unsupported
  methods, and unknown routes with the existing structured status contract.
- Keep `validation` limited to `none` or `luhn`; flags must remain exactly `g`.
- Limit regex, text, name, and query fields before Rust validation or matching.
- Preserve the request-generation/`AbortController` guard so an older `/scan` response
  cannot overwrite a newer preset selection.
- Escape dynamic HTML or use `textContent`; do not introduce an XSS path.
- Keep Rust scan results authoritative and preserve Luhn as a post-filter only.

## Local-first workflow

Local development is the default and does not require a remote Worker or Terraform.
When working in the application repository, follow its local-development commands.
The skill itself is guidance only; do not ask users to install project dependencies
merely to load this skill.

Terraform is optional. Use it only when the user explicitly requests Cloudflare
infrastructure or a production update. A local UI/test task must not require
Terraform, contact the remote Worker, or require Cloudflare credentials.

## Rust/WASM workflow

The pinned Rust dependency is `regex = 1.13.1`. The direct ABI exports memory,
allocation/deallocation, validation, error retrieval, and bounded scanning functions.

Rebuild through the repository script, not a host Rust installation:

```bash
./scripts/build-regex-validator.sh
```

Run it twice when changing Rust/WASM code and compare SHA-256 hashes. The generated
`src/regex_validator.wasm` is committed because Wrangler and Terraform deploy the
verified artifact. Update Rust source/tests and the artifact together.

## Verification loop

Before claiming a change is complete:

```bash
npm test
npx --yes wrangler@4.131.1 dev --local --port 8799
npx --yes wrangler@4.131.1 deploy --dry-run
```

If Terraform is installed and the task changes infrastructure, also run `terraform
fmt -check`, `terraform validate`, and a read-only plan. The plan must contain no
unexpected destroys. A normal Worker content update should be a new
`cloudflare_worker_version` and deployment, with the route ordered after the
deployment and proxied DNS record.

For runtime changes, start a real local Worker with Wrangler and probe `/`, `/health`,
and `/scan`. Test valid Rust syntax, malformed syntax, backreferences/lookaround,
oversized and chunked bodies, invalid validation/flags, `404`, and `405` behavior.

For UI changes, test desktop and mobile widths. Verify preset selection shows the
selected regex, note, and matches; specifically test switching quickly from the
credit-card preset to AWS so stale responses cannot restore card matches. Update
`docs/screenshots/` and README references when the user requests screenshots.

## Deployment and repository safety

- Deployment and Git publishing are separate operations.
- Do not run `terraform apply` blindly. Read the plan first and require zero
  unintended destroys. Preserve the existing Worker state migration.
- A production deployment targets `dlp-regex.itlinux.cc`; verify the live page,
  `/health`, and `/scan` after deployment.
- Git remotes are `origin` (public GitHub) and `gitlab` (private GitLab). Push the
  same verified commit to both when the user requests publishing.
- Before pushing, inspect staged paths and confirm no tfvars, tfstate, credentials,
  or generated local state is included.

## Known limitation

Cloudflare's provider currently warns that DLP `pattern.validation = "luhn"` is
deprecated but exposes no replacement. Keep the field for credit-card validation,
mention the warning in reports, and do not replace it with an invented attribute.
